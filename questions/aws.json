    "question": "What are the advantages of using SQS between S3 and Lambda functions?"
  },
  {
    "answer": "In the S3 bucket configuration, you set up event notifications specifying the event types to monitor (e.g., object created) and designate an SQS queue as the destination. You need to ensure the S3 bucket has permissions to send messages to the SQS queue. This setup directs S3 events to the queue for subsequent processing.",
    "question": "How do you configure S3 to send event notifications to SQS?"
  },
  {
    "answer": "SQS queues can handle high volumes of messages and buffer them, allowing Lambda functions to process events at a manageable rate.

This decoupling improves fault tolerance and makes it easier to scale individual components without affecting the entire system.",
    "question": "What is Amazon SQS, and how does it support decoupled architectures?"
  },
  {
    "answer": "When a consumer fails to process a message and doesn't delete it, SQS keeps the message in the queue and makes it visible again after the visibility timeout expires. This allows other consumers to retry processing the message automatically. The process repeats until the message is successfully processed or reaches the maximum receive count if a dead-letter queue is configured.",
    "question": "How does SQS handle message retries when processing fails?"
  },
  {
    "answer": "A Dead-Letter Queue is a special SQS queue where messages are sent if they can't be processed successfully after a specified number of attempts. DLQs help isolate problematic messages that might be causing failures, allowing developers to analyze and resolve issues without impacting the main queue's processing. This prevents faulty messages from continuously consuming resources and blocking other messages.",
    "question": "What is a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) in SQS, and why is it important?"
  },
  {
    "answer": "To configure a DLQ, you create a separate SQS queue to act as the dead-letter queue and set the redrive policy on the source queue to specify the DLQ and the maximum receive count. The maximum receive count determines how many times a message is retried before moving to the DLQ. This setup ensures failed messages are isolated after a defined number of processing attempts.",

  },
  {
    "answer": "Message batching allows you to send or receive up to 10 messages in a single API call using the SendMessageBatch or ReceiveMessage operations. Batching improves performance by reducing the number of API calls, lowering latency, and decreasing costs associated with frequent network requests. It enables higher throughput and more efficient processing of messages.",
    "question": "What is message batching in SQS, and how does it enhance performance?"
  },
  {
    "answer": "SQS automatically scales to handle high request rates, but there are API rate limits that, if exceeded, result in throttling errors. To manage throttling, you can implement exponential backoff in your application to retry failed requests after increasing delays. Monitoring your application's throughput and adjusting concurrency can also help stay within SQS limits.",
    "question": "How does SQS handle throttling, and what strategies can you use to manage it?"
  },
  {
    "answer": "The visibility timeout is the period during which a message is invisible to other consumers after being received by a consumer. If the message isn't deleted before the timeout expires, it becomes visible again for other consumers to process, enabling retries. Properly configuring the visibility timeout ensures messages are retried appropriately without causing duplication or delays.",
    "question": "What is the visibility timeout in SQS, and how does it impact message retries and processing?"
  },
  {
    "answer": "You can set the visibility timeout to a duration that exceeds the maximum expected processing time of your tasks. Additionally, you can use the ChangeMessageVisibility API to dynamically extend the visibility timeout if processing takes longer than expected. This prevents messages from reappearing in the queue and being processed concurrently by multiple consumers.",
    "question": "How can you adjust the visibility timeout to handle long-processing tasks without causing premature retries?"
  },
  {
    "answer": "To process messages in order, you can use Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues, which guarantee message ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues use message group IDs to preserve the order within a group but have a limited throughput compared to standard queues (up to 3,000 messages per second with batching). This approach is suitable when the order of operations is critical for your application.",
    "question": "How do you ensure messages are processed in order, and what are the limitations?"
  },
  {
    "answer": "Standard queues offer unlimited throughput, at-least-once delivery, and best-effort ordering, meaning messages might be delivered multiple times and out of order. FIFO queues guarantee exactly-once processing and preserve message order but have lower throughput limits. Both support retries and DLQs, but the choice depends on whether ordering and duplicate suppression are more important than higher throughput.",
    "question": "What are the differences between Standard and FIFO queues regarding retries, DLQs, and throughput?"
  },
  {
    "answer": "You can scale consumers horizontally by adding more instances or Lambda functions to process messages from the queue. Utilizing message batching allows each consumer to process multiple messages per request, improving efficiency. Monitoring queue metrics and adjusting concurrency or batch sizes helps manage throughput without hitting throttling limits.",
    "question": "How do you handle scaling consumers with SQS while considering batching and throttling?"
  },
  {
    "answer": "SQS can trigger AWS Lambda functions to process messages automatically, with Lambda polling the queue and invoking your function. You can configure the batch size for Lambda to receive multiple messages per invocation, improving efficiency. If message processing fails, you can set up a DLQ for the Lambda function to capture failed messages after retries, aiding in error handling.",
    "question": "How does SQS integrate with AWS Lambda, and what role do batching and DLQs play in this integration?"
  },
  {
    "answer": "Implement proper error handling in your consumers to catch exceptions and avoid unintentional deletions of messages. Use DLQs to capture messages that exceed the maximum receive count for further analysis. Adjust visibility timeouts and implement retries with backoff strategies to handle transient errors without losing messages.",
    "question": "What strategies can you use to prevent message loss in SQS due to processing errors or timeouts?"
  },
  {
    "answer": "Long polling reduces empty responses by allowing the ReceiveMessage call to wait up to 20 seconds for a message to become available. This decreases the number of API calls made when the queue is empty, reducing costs and throttling. Long polling makes message retrieval more efficient by minimizing unnecessary requests.",
    "question": "How does long polling in SQS work, and how does it affect message retrieval and throttling?"
  },
  {
    "answer": "Set the visibility timeout slightly longer than the maximum time your consumers need to process a message. Adjust the maximum receive count to allow a reasonable number of retries for transient issues without overloading the system. Balancing these settings ensures efficient retries while preventing messages from getting stuck in the queue or overwhelming the DLQ.",
